# Covid In Hungary
This is a small and simple web app created to show current COVID cases in Hungary. No JavaScript framework is here, because I am a beginner and I did not learn about that stuffs yet. There are some really helpful people reviewed the original code in reddt at r/learnprogramming and on the Discord servers of the courses of Jonas Schmedtmann and Andrei Neagoie. I have to make it responsive. Feel free the give me feedbacks.
